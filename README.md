# multilevelVaRTest
This function implements multilevel unconditional coverage tests of VaR forecasts for different quantiles. These tests achieve a higher statistical power then multiple unilevel tests. 
Theory based on "Evaluating the Accuracy of Value-at-Risk Forecasts: New Multilevel Tests" by Leccadito, Bofelli & Urga (2014). 
Code for the multilevel Christoffersen UC test is based on the function "VaRTest" from the "rugarch" package by Alexios Ghalanos.
